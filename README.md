This project showcases various server-side form validation techniques using PHP. It includes:

Validation using regex for name, number, email, phone, and password fields.
Creation of a signup form with checks for email, username, and password (ensuring the username is alphanumeric and 6 characters long, and the password is different from the username and at least 8 characters long).
Implementation of a form with fields for name, email, phone, country, gender, and interests, ensuring all fields are required, and specific validation rules are met.
